This is a copy of CondFormats/JetMETObjects, to enable stand-alone use of
jet energy corrections.
Slight changes have been made to enable stand-alone compilation and to avoid name collisions.
In particular, the Workaround.h file contains some code emulating cmssw edm::LogError to
minimize required changes in other places of the code.
